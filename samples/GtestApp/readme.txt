GtestApp is a sample project demonstrating usage of an externally-supplied source code module that does not supply a globifest manifest.  This builds a test application using GoogleTest.

To demonstrate parsing and see the output, run the build command from the top-level folder:

./build -i samples/GtestApp/GtestApp.gproj -o _Output

These files only exist to illustrate usage of the Globifest project packaging system, and may not build for actual compilers.
